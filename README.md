# hello-world

My name is Emunael but everyone calls me Dukes. I am currenlty developing my data science skills through [Dataquest](dataquest.io), who I highly recommend for anyone interested in learning data science. I will be frequently posting my projects on here, and as my skill set grows I hope to build progressively more robust projects.

Personally I have an undergraduate degree in Mathematics, an MBA with a concentration in Finance and a passion for analytics. I'm originally from [Zimbabwe](http://www.zimbabwetourism.net/), I've been living in the US for 8 years and fun fact I was an All-American track athlete for Penn State in 2013.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments or would like to collaborate on any projects.
